  <h2>1. Returns & Refunds</h2>
  <p>Returns are <strong>not accepted</strong>. In certain cases, we may offer a <strong>partial refund</strong> if there’s a genuine issue with your order.</p>
  <p>To be considered, please contact us within <strong>7 days</strong> of delivery with your order number, photos (if applicable), and details of the issue.</p>

  <h2>2. Handmade & In-House Printing</h2>
  <p>All items are <strong>printed in-house</strong> by hand. This means each piece is unique and may have <strong>slight imperfections</strong>, which add to its charm and individuality.</p>
  <p>Colours and sizes may vary slightly due to the nature of the printing process and screen display differences.</p>

  <h2>3. A Note from the Maker</h2>
  <p>I’m just one man, chasing my dream and pouring passion into every item I create. This isn’t a big factory, it’s me, my ideas, and my dedication to giving you something real. Your support means more than you know, and I promise I’ll always do my best to make sure you’re happy with your order.</p>
